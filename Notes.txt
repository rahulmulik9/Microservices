limits-service.maximum=996

How to created this file.
1)Create folder and open cmd : git init
2)Create this  limits-service.properties (name should be match with spring.application.name=limits-service in limit-service module)file in text editor and saved as .properties
3)Open cmd : git add *
4)Open cmd : git commit -m "Adding properties"


 Note : Dont commit it into folder
 This folder should not be included in directory where all modules are store


 2) Give spring.application.name=limits-service as name in limit-serive
 so when you run you localhost/8080 . values are fetched from new configuration file.
 So older values are 3,997 and new values are 4,996

 3) You can copy properties file and include in name as -dev and -qa in git config file

 spring.profiles.active=qa
 spring.cloud.config.profile=qa
